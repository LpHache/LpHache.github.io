You can dive into the orb you carry at fixed points and get more worlds. You can store worlds within each other to carry them all around. It's a really unique system that I haven\u2019t really seen before. Although it might seem confusing and complex at first, the game does a good job explaining exactly how everything works and leaving little room for error. I never got stuck more than a few minutes on any particular puzzle. ++++ Beautiful art style and good animations. The game just looks gorgeous and the worlds are all very distinct and pretty. The animations were natural and seamless, all the moving parts looked really well done. +++ Mysterious world and story.

You are an envoy from the Smoldering City, a town at the center of the map that is the only place that doesn't get destroyed by the Blightstorm. The Blightstorm is a terrible event that wipes out the entire map after a certain amount of time, including all settlements you made and the map layout (this is what defines an entire AtS run). In between storms you venture out to make settlements that will gather resources for the city (permanent upgrades to your runs) if they succeed, and bring you closer to fixing broken seals that are far away from the city(the objective of each run, fixing increasingly harder seals). A successful seal fixing will increase the time between storms, allowing you to venture further out to the harder seals. Now each settlement you make will be completely different, it's hard to explain every game mechanic here as there are so many, but you have to reach 14 victory points before you reach 14 impatience points and lose. You will have access to different buildings every run (can\u2019t rely on one in particular) and get access to new ones at set victory point levels. You get cornerstone choices to give bonuses as well that will be different each time. Your city will always have 3 of 5 possible races of villagers. Each one has different housing needs, complex food needs, and service needs to be happy. Very happy villagers will give you victory points so you want to fulfill as much as you can. However the forest isn\u2019t happy you are there, there are dangerous and forbidden glades all around you that have events in them. Solving them in time with the proper ressources will give you bonuses but if you can\u2019t finish it, you\u2019ll end up with huge negative modifiers. There\u2019s also a storm every 8 in-game minutes that will give huge debuffs to all your villagers and when they are too unhappy they will start leaving in droves, increasing the impatience and making it harder to run all the buildings in your settlement. It's all a very big balancing act to win your settlement and move on to the next to reach the seals. ++++ Extremely engaging and varied gameplay. This game is crazy fun, you take the frostpunk concept of keeping a city alive in adverse conditions and shove it into a repeatable roguelite shell and wow you get this game. Each settlement is so different with buildings, cornerstones, queen\u2019s orders, races, biomes, soil, traders, events encountered and more. Yes you build a city every run but they are never close to the same. ++++ Ton of strategy and planning involved. You need to deal with map modifiers. You need to keep track of fuel for your hearths by cutting wood or gathering coal. You need to pump out planks, bricks and fabrics as building materials to build homes and complex shelters. You need to set up farms and gathering camps to keep up with the food demand and start making complex foods using those basics like pies, porridge, skewers and more. You need to get service buildings like Taverns, temples, and bathhouses to please the different races of your city and supply those with ale, tea, incense, etc to satisfy everyone\u2019s needs. You need to pack provisions and goods in boxes to trade them with other cities and traders to make money to buy out stuff you can produce. You need to manage how angry the forest is at you and all the negative effects with cornerstones or upgrading your Hearths. You need to manage your collected rainwater to run your rainpunk engines that increase production. You need to manage the Blightrot spawning and corrupting your hearths. Every new villager means more mouths to feed, more housing required but also more hands to get to work. If you don't do even 1 of the things above, your town might fail and people will start leaving. It\u2019s extremely satisfying to get a good settlement rolling and producing everything. ++++ Meaningful upgrades and rewards. After almost every settlement you can go to the main city and upgrade something like better starting ressources, more trade routes, better prices and so much more. Always make you look forward to the next run with your upgrade. +++ Performs very well. This game opens and loads into your game in about 10 seconds flat. It's insane. Makes it so easy to just load in real quick for even just a few minutes anytime you want. Runs super well on x3 speed, never had any issues or bugs. +++ Good sound design. Important audio cues tell you when something needs your attention at all times. Nice little background music as well. +++ Super customizable difficulty. You have 4 basic difficulties that change a few major things. You can play with those as much as you want but each new seal demands a higher difficulty. The first three need to be beat at normal, hard and very hard respectively. Then there are 20 prestige levels and every single one makes one aspect significantly harder (costlier rerolls, longer storms, harder orders, more expensive buildings, etc) that need to be beaten in order to unlock the next. And the last 4 seals need to be beat at prestige 5, 10, 15 and 20 to beat the whole game. (I stopped at prestige 5) ++ Cool biomes. There are 6 different biomes each with their different modifiers and unique ways of playing on them. Really loved switching around which biome I'd build in. - The game can be long to finish (if you care about finishing things). At 120h, I still have about half the game left if I want to complete all upgrades and beat all the challenges, and that's with only 1 failed prestige 5 run. Each town at x3 speed can be up to 30-35mins long (without pausing, which you do A LOT of) and you\u2019ll have to make 5-7 towns before reaching a seal and restarting a new run. (But it's also really fun to do all of that so is it really that bad?) (and tbf, stopping after any seal you completed is also a super valid thing to do) - I want more biomes, and just more of everything. Visually it can be a bit samey at times with the forest and glades all looking alike, so I wish there was a bigger variety of in game areas to play around with.","title":"Against The Storm"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#against-the-storm","text":"","title":"Against The Storm"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#score-1010","text":"","title":"Score: 10/10"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#playtime-120-hours","text":"Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder game that is quite fantastic.

I only played through all campaigns and did not interact with mutliplayer or custom matches. The main story takes you through all the factions as you try to stop Gargarensis from releasing the Titans from the underwold. It throws you in a bunch of scenarios with various objectives that mostly all revolve around building a base, an army, and crushing your opponents. The Good ++++ Everything you loved from the original. This remaster stays very true to the original game and changed very little beyond graphial and ai improvements, bug fixes, and a few quality of life fixes. Everything you loved from classic AoM, you will love it here too. ++++ The campaign is actually really well done. With 32 missions in the main campaign and an extra 14 for the DLC campaign, it actually has a good chunk of content. Its not Starcraft 2 with impressive cutscenes but the story makes sense, the characters are nice and they found a good way to make you play all factions evenly throughout. Was a really comoplete way to experience the game. I also really enjoyed how different they made each scenario. A lot of care went into making sure each missions had something to make it unique and not just another 1v1 base rush. +++ RTS are fun, and this is no exception. Game is well balanced, interesting units and ages and building. Just fun to play really. +++ The units and god powers are just cool. Just in general, I really enjoyed the army compositions, especially myth units. They also didnt have very complicated abilities that required intense micro which isn't my thing. God powers well, those are just a fun addition (like meteors and lightning). ++ Banger soundtrack. Thats it, the classic soundtrack is still great. The Bad - Maybe a tad long. While I still think it was fine as a whole, i think a couple of missions could have been left out that weren't super interesting. 50 total missions is quite a lot. -- Too many scenarios starting in Age 3. The charm of most of the Age Of XYZ games are that you have to progress through ages to unlock new stuff, and in AoM you have to decide between 2 gods each with their own units and tech. Thats a really fun and interesting part of the game depending on what you focus is. However, in the campaign the game starts you in age 3 in like over half the missions and i thought that was really unfortunate. Age 4 is a luxury that isn't really necessary to win in most cases either, and sometimes even that was blocked. I think I got to choose my 2nd age only once. I guess its to shorten mission times and control the balance more but I wish it had been different. -- Wish we got to play with Titans more.

Set in the early 90's, you play as Rook, a member of the CIA's black ops squad. You spend the campaign chasing down and ever blacker secret ops team members gone rogue, named Pantheon. This paramilitary group has lots of funds and soldiers and have infiltrated high level US government. You must defeat Patheon and thwart the biological attack they are planning. The game also has a multitude of multiplayer modes and the amazing round based zombie mode is back with 3 new maps. Final Opinion I had a great time with this game overall. The campaign was a lot of fun with all the missions types and going back to a home base in between. You get lots of time to talk to characters too. The story didn't hit as hard as Modern Warfare 2 but it was pretty well done. Had a ton of fun in the zombies mode as well, the eldritch horror map is really hard and took me a few tries to reach the end (hard to do solo and takes 1h30 to reach the end, still haven't beaten it). Wish I had friends to play it with, would be way more fun (alas the game is not free). The UI and menus are pretty bad though, along with cringe AI use. The Good ++++ The zombie mode is fun as hell. It kept a lot of what made it great in the first game it appeared in (don't change what works eh) but added lots of fun mechanics. As usual you start with your pistol but can buy guns off walls or try your luck at the mystery box. You can upgrade your gun's tier or feed it to the \"Pack-a-punch\" for a massive upgrade. Theres new perks and as you play more you unlock ways to customize each perk to your liking. The guns are fun, the zombie are dangerous, the maps are really cool. The first 2 maps have stories you can do solo. The second one in particuliar is quite crazy. ++++ Varied main campaign missions. For an FPS I was quite impressed. Some missions were actually open world with some objectives and optional content. Others were hitman-lite where you gather clues and intel with multiple ways to complete your goal. You also had the vehicle moments, base defense mission, and even a zombie mission. +++ Story was pretty good. CoD in the past always had surprisingly good campaigns. While this doesn't beat out the old Modern Warfare games it stands on its own with a good story and characters (Even if I find the idea of an ever more secret blacker ops team existing kinda silly). +++ The multiplayer is exactly as expected. Its fast, its fun, its arcade-y and nonsensical. It is action packed though and chasing killstreaks is still fun. Lots of different modes and playlists too. ++ I love home bases. In this campaign you go back to a home base with a few upgrades where you can talk to your team. Its nice. It even has a pretty cool puzzle in it. The Bad -- The UI and menu experience is abysmal. The main menu is an abomination of different battle passes, game modes, events and even other games. Loading into the campaign closes your game and reboots it in campaign, but theres no way to just boot it in campaign from the start. Too many menus for customization as well. -- Performance issues. Pre-loading shaders too like 5 hours, but somehow persisted even after I closed the game. Once it had finished the game ran well but before that the MP just was unplayable. -- Use of AI for art and voice. Shame on you Activision. - Game is more fun with friends. This is not a free game, I had no friends on the game.","title":"Black Ops 6"},{"location":"reviews/blackops6/#call-of-duty-black-ops-6","text":"","title":"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6"},{"location":"reviews/blackops6/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/blackops6/#playtime-37-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 37 hours"},{"location":"reviews/blackops6/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/blackops6/#storefront-game-pass","text":"Black Ops 6 is the latest installment of the classic FPS game.

Theres new perks and as you play more you unlock ways to customize each perk to your liking. The guns are fun, the zombie are dangerous, the maps are really cool. The first 2 maps have stories you can do solo. The second one in particuliar is quite crazy. ++++ Varied main campaign missions. For an FPS I was quite impressed. Some missions were actually open world with some objectives and optional content. Others were hitman-lite where you gather clues and intel with multiple ways to complete your goal. You also had the vehicle moments, base defense mission, and even a zombie mission. +++ Story was pretty good. CoD in the past always had surprisingly good campaigns. While this doesn't beat out the old Modern Warfare games it stands on its own with a good story and characters (Even if I find the idea of an ever more secret blacker ops team existing kinda silly). +++ The multiplayer is exactly as expected. Its fast, its fun, its arcade-y and nonsensical. It is action packed though and chasing killstreaks is still fun. Lots of different modes and playlists too. ++ I love home bases. In this campaign you go back to a home base with a few upgrades where you can talk to your team. Its nice. It even has a pretty cool puzzle in it.","title":"The Good"},{"location":"reviews/blackops6/#the-bad","text":"-- The UI and menu experience is abysmal. The main menu is an abomination of different battle passes, game modes, events and even other games. Loading into the campaign closes your game and reboots it in campaign, but theres no way to just boot it in campaign from the start. Too many menus for customization as well. -- Performance issues. Pre-loading shaders too like 5 hours, but somehow persisted even after I closed the game. Once it had finished the game ran well but before that the MP just was unplayable. -- Use of AI for art and voice. Shame on you Activision. - Game is more fun with friends.

You rescue creatures by playing songs to them and bringing them to bots, and it also allows you to control them to solve exploration puzzles. Sometimes the creatures are infected and you have to cleanse them with a relic you find which will be imbued with a few abilities. Ava also hosts an intelligent species of bird-like folk that guide you to the different areas of the map, send you on quests, and play a bit part in the central story of rescuing everyone (including them). Final Opinion In the end, I think the game was just \"okay\". It never really had any highs or big moments. Once you rescued your first creature, nothing new is every really introduced for the rest of the game and it all becomes the same. Story was decent and well told with some nice characters, but it was a bit of a chore to reach the end.

The Good +++ The world of Ava is very beautiful. Exploration is nice with the 4 different biomes and the vibrant color palette of the game.

You are stuck on an island in an endless time loop except it seems you're able to remember things even if the day resets. You're one of the nine founding members (visionnaries) of this facility and you quickly realise you want to break this endless loop as there is no end in sight for it and that's no way to live. To do this you learn you need to kill all the founding members before the day resets to destabilize the loop. As such, you explore 4 distinct maps during 4 different time periods (morning, noon, afternoon, night) to uncover secrets and ways to kill each member in a single day. You can only explore one zone per time period, and time moves to the next period the moment you exit an area. So you have to plan out your day properly or risk having to redo it all. You get a nice variety of guns and powers stolen from other visionnaries. Throughout the game you have another visionnary, Julianna, who also keeps her memory and teases you and occasionaly also trying to kill you during your day. Game ends once you successfuly kill each member in a single day. The Good ++++ Main characters are well done. I really loved the MC and his voice actor. Lots of personality coming through with nice character growth as the game goes on. Julianna was done similarly well. ++++ Maps are rewarding to explore. Yes there are only 4 maps, but they have very different enemy layouts and opening depening on what time of day you come. A map in the morning won't play out the same way when you visit at night which makes revisits always fresh and interesting. They are also a good size to cross them pretty quickly when you know what you are doing while leaving room to explore a lot if that is you goal. Struck a nice balance there. There are also loads of hidden secrets if you have the patience and interest to uncover them. Some older version of me might have, but I held back the completionist this time around. +++ Time loops are neat. Like with Outer Wilds, I just think its a neat concept that your main weapon is your knowledge and you could have finished it at any time. +++ The weapons support many playstyles and are fun. Combat is important, and the weapons feel good to use. You can be nailing people in the head for steal or melting them with a laser beam. You could be going in guns blazing akimbo pistol with explosive headshots too. Fun for the whole family. ++ I liked the powers. Some were powers you commonly see in every game like stealth and teleport, but there were different cool ones like linking enemies and blinding them. Each also had two extra upgrades. Bit of a shame that most of the time the best course of action was just to nail headshot guys so I didn't end up using them much (except invisiblity). ++ Cool multiplayer idea. At any time you can decide to play as Julianna instead of Colt and go around invading other player's loops to ruin their day. Fun idea kind of like dark souls invading. I turned it off though cause once I \"paused\" to go pee and came back to all my lives lost cause I got invaded. I need my pauses. +/- The story is serviceable. For most of the game, it was pretty good. Loved discovering about the island's past and the characters on it, but I found the ending really unsatisfying. I'm someone who likes answers, and there sure as hell were none there. The Bad -- The load times can be pretty long. Even on my NVME SSD, it could take minutes to load a map. -- The AI is plain bad. This was a common complaint of the game and it is very true. The enemies just aren't very interesting to fight at all. They simply rush your position and shoot you at near point blank range if they heard you or stay where they are and shoot. They dont have powers, they don't use items except a couple of grenades (rarely), and all have the same weapons as you. There's no real cover system either. Fighting them alone is basically trivial but the moment a large amount have noticed you you simply die because you have no defensive tools (shields or heals) and no real area attacks either. It makes going for the action road a real bummer since it feels like it wasn't designed for that. -- No enemy variety. In conjunction with the previous point, it made combat fairly boring. The only difference were their weapons (and lets be honest difference betwen AR and shotgun was meaningless for enemies) and that the visionnaries had 1 power. But they died just as fast so its not like it made an interesting boss fight or anything. There was even a system where you can tag enemies and it displays their weapons, but also details like \"aggressive, has good aim, persistent, etc\" and it gets you thinking you can use this strategically but its just useless. Game could have used enemies with shields or with some armor and such. -- Lack of present day worldbuilding.

The main systems of this game are exploration, choice, story, and turn-based tactical combat. The game is divided into four story acts all taking place in different locations with entirely new maps to chart out and explore. Now, there is a ton to go through with this game so I\u2019ll try to stick to the important stuff and keep it short. As always, let's talk about the great stuff first. The combat in this game is really excellent. The magical and physical armor system combat with all the buffs, debuffs, status elements and various environmental hazards created by spells made each encounter wildly different. The hundreds of abilities available for combat also made it so you can win encounters in a myriad of ways (or lose because of bad strategic calls). Second amazing thing about this game is the classes. Each class has a ton of skill options to choose from that provide unique effects on the battlefields, and the option to dip into any other class skills easily makes for truly interesting characters to pilot with a fun toolbox for each encounter. Not to mention some of those skills were insanely fun to use and were pretty epic. Third is quests and explorations. Exploring in this game is extremely rewarding as you often find high level gear and unique items in the most remote locations. It also allows you to find alternate routes for quests which I found really cool. There were also often 1-2 secret passageways leading to enemy bases that allowed you to sneak in the base, or sneak past guards. Really felt like the game was letting you approach each encounter the way you wanted to. This led to quests being a lot more interesting, each having different outcomes on the paths you took coming in, as well as your dialogue choices over the course of the quest. Additionally the companions were all pretty interesting, I liked their stories more than the main quest, I just wish they were a bit more fleshed out. Finally, I thought the first 2 acts were super enjoyable to explore and delve deeper into the story and all the characters. Final additional note: The last boss fight of the game was super awesome and very challenging Now for the less enjoyable parts. First and foremost in the whole inventory system. While the loot and equipment grind was fun, always finding and getting newer and better gear, the rest of the inventory was a pain. First, important story items and not always marked as such and are easily misplaced, sold, or otherwise lost. Second, crafting is completely wasted in this game. All the components are basically wasted and just hog up room and weight. This is because nothing you can craft ever comes close to being as good as anything you find by exploring or even simply buying. Crafting should reward players for investing into it and getting recipes but the game doesn't do that (and there are barely any recipes you can get). Lastly, I really wanted one of my characters to make good use of bombs, grenades, and traps, but those items scale so horribly they are basically useless in the second half of the game and it made me sad. I wish one of the classes supported it better. As for the story, I found it increasingly hard to keep track of once we reached acts 3 and 4. Gods are good, gods are bad, allies are now enemies, enemies are now allies, nothing matters except that one end scene of act 3 and the final few moments of act 4. I thought act 4 dragged on too much, I was ready for a good final streamlined act to lead in to the boss but it was just as open as previous acts. One last point is basic QOL features being locked behind mods, which in turn disable achievements. Simple things like running faster, everyone having the pet pal skill, and source regenerating during sleep made the game so much smoother, especially since source in general was constantly overcosted both in memory slots and how much was available in game. Overall , I give Divinity: Original Sin 2 a 9 /10 score. I believe it's a game with incredible depth from the characters to the quests to the class system and skills available. It starts off strong with immense maps providing multiple approaches to the world and also rewarding adventurous players with treasure for their exploration. The fights are well built, and the combat is fun and strategic. However, the game struggles to close up its story beats in an adequate manner leading to an awkward ending where everyone is evil. It also made the last 2 acts feel longer than they should have been. The inventory is also a huge mess paired with a crafting system that feels incomplete and does not scale well at all. Finally, the source system felt imbalanced with default source being barely available in game in conjunction with source skills requiring 2 or even 3 memory points each felt very frustrating. Super happy I played it though I had a blast with the spells and classes and having 4 unique builds to pilot every fight. The Good ++++ Flexible class system, builds and skills ++++ Rewarding exploration +++ Strategic combat +++ Intriguing characters with fun quests +++ 4 interactive open world maps ++ Interesting main story The Bad - Rushed and confusing story ending -- Useless crafting system with poor scaling (like throwables) -- Near necessary QOL features locked behind mods (disabling achievements)","title":"Divinity Original Sin 2"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#divinity-original-sin-2","text":"","title":"Divinity: Original Sin 2"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#score-910","text":"","title":"Score: 9/10"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#playtime-115-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 115 hours"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#storefront-steam","text":"Divinity Original Sin 2 is, as Simon put it, an epic high fantasy RPG played from a top-down, isometric perspective.

It is a society survival game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where everything has frozen over and a few stragglers are trying to survive the cold. However, the first game really focused on a small population where everyone mattered down to individuals. This game assumes the events of the first game were successful and the city has grown massively. You now have to deal with tens of thousands of habitants, and production on a much larger scale than the first game. The mechanics are still similar, but is very much a different game (in a good way). You have to manage your city's income, materials, goods, food, and housing to keep the people happy and content with you. You have to deal with opposite factions pulling your city in different directions while exploring the lands beyond your city and secure outposts. The city must survive. The Good ++++ The large amount of systems that just work well together. What I mean by this is that the game has about 6-7 ressources you need to keep track of and that all play really well into each other. This is my favourite part of the game, just managing my city to make sure I get a good balance of everything. An example of this would be: I'm low on food, so I need more workers on it but I have none, so I have to accept new people in the city, which increases demand for housing and goods and food, so I must build more districts, which needs workforce and materials... and so on and so forth. You're constantly making compromises for one ressource over another. +++ The faction systems were more engaging. In this game you have 2 communities, and each has a radicalised faction that stems from them. These factions will always be at odds with each others and it makes an interesting dynamic regarding what you reseach and which policies you try to pass in congress. You have to bribe, promote condemn, and make promises often to keep the city running and prevent protests from shutting down parts of your city, or even going into civil war and self destructing. +++ They really improved the frostland systems. You get scout teams that you can send to map out neighbouring regions. This allows you to find ressource caches, stranded people, and the like. You'll also have to make morally dubious decisions like support slave barons or risk your people to attack them. You also find places to set down permanent outposts which can manage in addition to your city. You can get up to 3-4 or these going each with their own ressource needs and its a puzzle in itself to manage them all. ++ The main story is pretty good. I think the main story provided very coold big decision moments that really shaped your playthrough and forced harsh decisions on you. Good options for replayability. ++ Endless mode is appreciate. Once you are done the campaign you can head to Utopia Builder which offer different maps not seen in the main campaign and new factions with different wants as well. You can customize a few things including your main objective but can keep going for almost forever. Nice to have. The Bad - Maybe a tad too easy. I choose difficulty 2/5 for both my runs because there's a lot of warnings about the difficulty but I do wish I had bumped it up a bit. I eventually got to pretty unloseable points with millions of resources stockpiled, which takes away a bit from the normaly tense management of ressources. Experienced people sould do at least 3/5. - Not enough endgame. Maybe a bit related to the first point, but I wish I had a bit more objectives to do later in the game or even visibly achievements to work towards. The end point for a utopia is otherwise pretty arbitrary. -- Some performance issues. Past week 500 in game some things start showing signs of stuttering a bit. Saving times start taking a while too.

I played a few levels and it was neat. +++ Really good enemy variety. The \u201cvisitors\u201d were all appropriately creepy and well designed.

You are only equipped with ranged attacks (and most require a bit of charging) and a block, while enemies are mostly melee with a few exceptions.

There's no cover or any particular strategies besides some stealthing so all encounters end up feeling sameish once you\u2019ve seen the enemy before.

You make it your mission to rescue your crew and stop The Banished at all costs. ++++ Great Halo combat. This is another home run for great Halo gameplay. The weapons are fun and responsive, the fights are challenging, and you often get the usual suite of cool Halo vehicles to mow down your opponents with. The grappling hook to throw bombs and quickly reposition was great as well. Few other gadgets like shield wall, dash, and sensor kept things interesting too. ++++ Sweet new weapons. The Hydra (Explosive guided rounds) was a blast to use, commando (LMG) was fun as well as the Shock rifle (stuns) and Skewer (grunt sniper). They also added weapons variants for ALL weapons that modified their stats and use (Like a shorter range sniper with more ammo and a gap-closing Gravity hammer). +++ The open world wasn\u2019t too bloated. What I mean is that there weren\u2019t dozens of pointless badly written sidequests in this game. Yes, there were Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) to capture a lot, but those were basically fast travel points and areas to spawn vehicles / the loadout you wanted. So they felt good to capture. The rest were all optional easy to do stuff like rescue spartans, find some cores (upgrade component for your skills), assassinate special grunt targets (to unlock their variant weapon) and a few bases to sabotage. Good little objectives that made sense to do and rewarded you all with points to unlocked better loadouts at FOBs. Also fully optional (missions are fast travel points too, don\u2019t even need FOBs). +++ Decent story. It isn\u2019t really as grand or epic as other entries in the stories, but it's a lot more personal. You get a lot of character development about Chief as a human that I really liked as he explores his feelings a little deeper beyond what we usually see. The story of the banished is interesting as yell even if they do too many monologues. ++ Good soundtrack and sound design. Halo soundtrack is always a banger, and continues this trend here. Where the main theme hits you can\u2019t help but feel hyped. Of course they remix it a bit every time and it's not my favorite iteration, it's still good.

Grunt headshots, sniper sounds, vehicle sounds, all classics. --- It's a great FPS game with a Halo skin, but it\u2019s not a good HALO campaign. What I mean is that usually Halo campaigns are more well crafted. They are epic set pieces and each mission has a goal and you\u2019re going to a bunch of different places. You have a certain sense of scale with the UNSC armies and all the leaders you talk to. You have the good intro missions, the stealth missions with snipers, the Scorpion tank mission where you blast through shit, the sick final where you take down a big bad or run away from explosions. That\u2019s what makes a good Halo campaign. This game has none of that. The missions all happen in the same biome or within forerunner structures. Because of the open world, they just feel like bigger \u201ctake down this outpost\u201d activities instead of proper missions. You also spend way too much time traversing the same 4 hallways for like half the game walking through the same interior structures forever. It's also a very lonely game. You only have the AI and 1 soldier you talk to for the whole game and that's it. While it helped with the chief's character, it was a bit bland. -- Singular location got old fast.

The process goes wrong and he gets fused with his iPod. Now labelled a defect, he fights for his survival and to take down a megacorp while infused with the power of feeling the beat. In this game you fight enemies at the sound of the music to trigger combos with light and heavy attacks, while traversing a colorful corporate campus with classic platforming gameplay. Final Opinion I had a lot of fun with this game. I just really loved the cast of characters that they made for Chai's team and all their interactions were really great. The game also just oozes with styles from its soundtrack, to visual / level design, and boss fights. It can be a bit hard however at the end and require some amount of focus to stay on beat. Definitely recommend this game. The Good ++++ The music slaps. As expected with a rythm game (but not always garanteed), the music is great. It compliments the combat and boss fights perfectly, and it is very upbeat and fun. ++++ The writing is actually good. I loved the writing in this game, it toed the line between cringy trying-too-hard and quippy one-liners perfectly. The result is fun dialogue that lands well, but knows its limits. ++++ Great team of NPC's. This goes with the previous point a bit, but I loved the people that joined Chai's team. They had great personality and the good writing helped a lot. +++ Pretty unique world. Hi-Fi rush has a very unique art style. It's close to Borderlands cell-shaded look but a lot more colorful and pop-y. Combine that with factories and busy construction sites that all move to the beat of the music and you've got yourself a visually stunning world to explore. It did however get pretty busy on screen at times though. Notes +++ Combat is well executed. It doesn't punish too hard for missing beats, but gives good rewards when you do. There are a lot of combos and playstyles you can go for to switch things up between levels. There are also team up abilities with the members of your team which are cool to execute. +++ Platforming is tight. Game doesnt massively innovate in this area, but they designed the levels really well. Lots of fun traversal, small puzzles, different camera angles, and small jumping challenges. It was nice that exploring was pretty rewarding with items, without being much of an open world. Kind of like finding small secret areas. +++ Cool boss fights. I was happy that the bosses weren't just bigger mobs. They all had unique challenges to themwith great set pieces and an even better soundtrack. Fun to fight. ++ Good length. I just love a good 15h game that delivers exactly on its premise and doesn't drag on. The Bad - Hard to remember combos. You get accumulate a lot of moves in this game, and its really hard to remember most of them during combat and resorting to light attack spam isn't as fun. It didn't help that any damage interrupted combos so in harder fights it was sometimes not even worth it to try the fun long combos. - Too much parrying for me. Controversial opinion I know. I have my hangups with parrying and the last half of the game put a lot of emphasis on that mechanic. - Being on the beat can be hard. I found I played short amounts of time because I was mentally drained after a level of trying to focus on staying on the beat.","title":"Hi-Fi Rush"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#hi-fi-rush","text":"","title":"Hi-Fi rush"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#score-910","text":"","title":"Score: 9/10"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#playtime-16-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 16 hours"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#storefront-game-pass","text":"Hi-Fi Rush is a rythm hack'n'slash game where you play as Chai, a pretty normal guy wanting to get his lost arm replaced with a robotic prosthetic.

I was happy that the bosses weren't just bigger mobs. They all had unique challenges to themwith great set pieces and an even better soundtrack. Fun to fight. ++ Good length. I just love a good 15h game that delivers exactly on its premise and doesn't drag on.","title":"The Good"},{"location":"reviews/hifirush/#the-bad","text":"- Hard to remember combos. You get accumulate a lot of moves in this game, and its really hard to remember most of them during combat and resorting to light attack spam isn't as fun. It didn't help that any damage interrupted combos so in harder fights it was sometimes not even worth it to try the fun long combos. - Too much parrying for me. Controversial opinion I know. I have my hangups with parrying and the last half of the game put a lot of emphasis on that mechanic. - Being on the beat can be hard. I found I played short amounts of time because I was mentally drained after a level of trying to focus on staying on the beat.","title":"The Bad"},{"location":"reviews/hogwartslegacy/","text":"Hogwarts: Legacy Score: 8.5/10 Playtime: 42 hours Platform: PC Storefront: Epic Games Hogwarts Legacy is an action-adventure game set in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. You start the game as a new fifth year student joining the school for the first time. You quickly discover you have a rare ability to see and wield forms of ancient magic others cannot, and that an evil is seeking you out for being involved in his affairs. You spend the game going to classes and learning new spells and potions, all the while investigating ancient magic through the help of some old professors and defending the Hogwarts valley. The Good ++++ Dynamic combat. Despite some people finding it a bit repetitive, I thought the combat was one of the strong points of the game. You eventually have over 20 different spells you can use with many of them having combos with each other such as: exploding a frozen enemy, smashing down a levitating enemy, or even turning enemies into explosive barrels and yeeting them at enemies (my favorite). Almost all enemies had specific weaknesses to look out for as well that helped stun them and leave them vulnerable, like flipping a troll club back on its head, levitating toads by their tongue when they try to lash at you, or interrupting enemy spell casts so it blows up in their face. On top of the spells, you had half a dozen potions and a few plants you could use during combat to mix things up. Each combat has bonus objectives as well that gave hints to enemy weaknesses and encouraged using different tools and consumables during fights which was nice. All of this led to a well rounded and interesting combat experience. I only wish the \"basic cast\" was a bit more interesting. ++++ The castle is insane. Hogwarts is done in such beautiful detail. I loved exploring every little hallway and solving all the puzzles and secrets I could find. You could tell a lot of love went into designing this location and its the highlight of the game as a Harry Potter fan. Lots of students within and in class try to get you mixed in with their shenanigans (Weasley). ++++ The Room of Requirements was a great idea. To help catch up with your studies, you are given access to the RoR which transforms into your little home base with loads of customization. You can transform every wall, ceiling, floor to make the decor you prefer and add countless decorations to your liking from lamps, tables, shevles, paintings, statues and much more. The decoration tools are advanced and well detailed and any base building fan will feel right at home. Beyond being pretty, it also serves to add all your utility stations. You can put down potion tables for brewing, growing pots to grow your combat plants, and stations to upgrade your armor. ++++ Beasts are cute as hell. You can rescue beasts from poachers, and the RoR evolves to make some vivarium's for your beasts to roam free which is insane. You get to pet them and feed them and build homes and its cute and you get materials and you can even breed them and get cute babies. I really enjoyed rescuing a bunch of beasts and building a collection. +++ Attending classes is fun. You get to attend every class at least once where you usually learn something new and really live that student life. It takes you around the castle and usually there's a little class montage that happens. Its authentic and a lot of people wished this section was more developed but for this type of game I think it struck a good balance. Felt like the early HP movies. +++ Large world to explore. The map outside of Hogwarts is actually huge. There is lot's of exploring if thats you thing, and can be fun for a while. Filled with activities such as: Rescuing beasts, clearing poacher / goblin camps, Merlin puzzles, treasure caves, astronomy tables, broom flying trials, and more. +++ The story was better than I thought. A lot of disappointement online had to do with the story. I found it to be interesting and progressed nicely. I do think there were some pacing problems but otherwise it had a lot of good moments even if it was a little predictable. Mostly that each part barely held any new information or twists. +++ Solid side quests. There were 3 main companion quest lines that were really interesting, even more than the main story. Few other ones on the map were good as well, like the haunted chest. Too bad its hard to say before doing it if its a boring fetch quest or a good one. ++ Seasons changing is nice. As you progress the main story the seasons change which make the world feel well alive and gives a good sense of progression in time. ++ Broom and mounts are cool additions. While there might not be quidditch, you do get to fly around the world on your broom and I found it to be a fun way to get around. You also get a hippogriff mount which is obviously cool. The Bad - Low action at times. Understandable as a student though, as the castle isn't under siege. It did mean that most of the action happened outside Hogwarts, away from the cool castle. - A bit long to unlock everything. I think an issue here is they actually show you all the locked spells right from the start. So it's all very predictable but takes a while to unlock all. Then it gets a bit stale when you get the last spell since you know there won't be anything new. I wish the unlocks had remained hidden. - Bad altered voice. Took a deeper voice than default, clearly was just a bad digital filter on it. Was sad. -- Holding button for actions suck. Seriously stop asking me to hold A for 5 seconds to close menus, open chests, or do anything. Just click once. Please. -- Bit of dissonance between being a student, but also murdering people. Its very weird to be basically a high school yet continuously murdering other wizards. Even if they are \"bad people\" such as poachers and kidnappers. Its weird for teachers and adults to not seriously ask wtf is wrong with you or jail you for these crimes. Don't get me started on the absolute lack of consequences for using unforgiveable curses willy nilly as if they were no worse than expelliarmus. -- The equipment / armor systems felt underdeveloped. The armor grind was kind of annoying for the first 50% of the game. You were always just stat swapping with nothing interesting. It got better when you unlocked the magic loom and the possibility to enchant things though. You could transmog, but it only stuck to the item and not the slot, so you had to reapply every time. Equipment only stats against enemies that pretty much always matched your level felt kind of pointless though. I understand it helped tie in the beasts for upgrades but i wish the system did more, or simply was removed. -- Map too big, with underwhelming rewards. As fun as the open world was for a while, in the 3rd act you reach a new zone, and it is massive. The open world activities have gotten old by that point and the thought of having to explore this area was daunting, even for me. The biome was more interesting, but I was sick of the same trials and just sped through the story by then. It also sucks that most rewards are armor pieces that suck more than what you have equipped. There are no cool weapons to find or spells. -- Wasted Characters . All the cool and fleshed out students and friends from companions' quests basically don't exist outside of their story which is a shame. Wish the game had done more with the characters it had. Perhaps interactions with the main story, an effect on the ending, meeting them around school and such. --- I had the worst damn stutter. I had this weird thing were I got a frame drop every time I cast a spell. It was annoying as hell and made combat super jumpy and hard. Might be my setup that sucked though, didn't always happen.","title":"Hogwarts Legacy"},{"location":"reviews/hogwartslegacy/#hogwarts-legacy","text":"","title":"Hogwarts: Legacy"},{"location":"reviews/hogwartslegacy/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/hogwartslegacy/#playtime-42-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 42 hours"},{"location":"reviews/hogwartslegacy/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/hogwartslegacy/#storefront-epic-games","text":"Hogwarts Legacy is an action-adventure game set in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

In this game you start off a few years after the end of the first story and with most of your crew having move on to other endeavours. Eventually you learn about a secret planet beyond an impassable abyss that could help the resistance grow, and be safe from the empire. An old jedi has once made a compass to reach that planet and you spend your time going around the galaxy to find a way to get a compass a reach the planet. In classic action adventure fashion, gameplay involes a lot of combat encounters, exploration puzzles and skill challenges, collectibles, and boss fights. The Good ++++ Animations feel great and look awesome. I'm mostly talking about the fighting here. You have a lot of possible combos with your lightsaber and it just looks buttery smooth. Even with the long dual blade you just spin and dash and attack in 3 different directions with style. No weird clipping or rough transitions between moves, just looking awesome. ++++ Combat is really fun, cool lightsaber stances . You start off with most of your abilities (force push, pull, double jump, throw) and stances (single handed, dual-bladed) from the last game. However you gain 3 new stances in this game (dual wield, two-handed crossguard, and blaster / saber) which all play super differently from each other with not a single move in common. They each have their own skill tree as well with 4 or 5 combos each which makes for a lot of variety in fighting. Theres a good amount of different enemies so its always fun trying out different stances for different foes. Couple that with new force powers like lift, crush and confusion, and every encounter stays fresh. This is als oone of the few games where I found parrying enjoyable. I attribute this to parrying providing tangible benefits in combat as well as enemies not have weird attack delays like enemies in souls type games often do. When you see an attack coming, it'll land when you expect it to. ++++ Exploration is rewarding. Almost every branching path you find end with a reward, be it a cosmetic or some currency for a shop back in the hubs. There are a lot of little secret areas too for those with a good eye and like some small skill challenges. Never felt like my time was wasted trying to explore the map. There are also some mounts now that help with traversal if you dont want to fast travel too much. It helped that the puzzles and challenges hit the right spot of \"not a breeze, but never frustrating either.\" ++++ The worlds are gorgeous. Easy to tell from the trailers, the world is very detailed and feels nicely lived in. Super gorgeous points of view as well. Just overall beautiful. +++ The story is meaningful and has lots of good character progression. Love me a good story where you can feel like the characters are actually going through some stuff and overcoming it. I like the overall arcs were fun and there were good set pieces throughout. There were a lot of fun side characters as well but I just wish they did more than stand around the saloon the whole time. The side quests also felt meaningful and not just useless fetch quests such as rescuing people, exploring old jedi temples, defeating mighty beasts or shrugging off bounty hunters. ++ Great character customization You can change your hair, your beard, your pants and shirt and coat, 8 different lightsaber parts + 4 color accents with over 10 color pallets, 5 BD-1 robot parts with colors as well, and 3 blaster parts. Tons to make to your liking! ++ Great customization in settings Shoutout to the settings. You can very finely adjust stuff like parry timings, damage taken / dealt, how many hints you want in game, if you want to be able to skip dialog, among others. ++ Well implemented New Game + mode. I have too many games to play to do new game + on most, but this would be a contender. They give you a few cool options like new lightsaber colors (red, rainbow), option for entirely new and harder combat encounters for most of the game, option for increased damage for friends and foes, and a perk that changes how you look every time you die. Soundss like a good time for a replay. ++ Tons of shortcuts for easy exploration. After every almost single jumping or climbing section, you unlock a shortcut to skip it the next time around. Its really appreciated and makes coming back to those areas much less frustrating. ++ Good dialogue. Game is fully voiced like the previous one and the actors really nail it. Theres also a lot of very fun banter with all the dumb droids and stormtroopers that I enjoyed. + No ability reset at game start. No being locked up and losing your saber, no weird memory loss. You're still the same strong fighter with all your powers and thats appreciated + You can pet the cute creatures. Nice. The Bad --- Optimization is rough, stuttering frames There aren't many loading screens in the game but theres often a lot going on on-screen at once which cause frame loss pretty often. I had to reduce to medium settings to make it bearable but it was quite unfortunate how bad it was. It really permeatted the whole experience. -- No fast travel between planets To go along with the first point, you often have to go through long animations with poor loading to change planets instead of simply fast traveling to a known point. Seemed like it could have been better.","title":"Jedi Survivor"},{"location":"reviews/jedisurvivor/#star-wars-jedi-survivor","text":"","title":"Star Wars: Jedi Survivor"},{"location":"reviews/jedisurvivor/#score-910","text":"","title":"Score: 9/10"},{"location":"reviews/jedisurvivor/#playtime-53-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 53 hours"},{"location":"reviews/jedisurvivor/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/jedisurvivor/#storefront-xbox-game-pass","text":"Star Wars: Jedi Survivor is the 2nd action adventure Star Wars game where you play as Cal Kestis.

You switch between all the fellowship characters as you go throw all the main action story beats that are in the movies. In between missions there is an open world where you can solve a bunch of puzzles using all the characters, do simple quests, and hunt for all the collectibles / achievments. Final Opinion As my first Lego game, I sort of expected going into it that it would be a more silly interpretation of the movies with loads of visual gags. I was so wrong. It's mostly a 1 to 1 recreation of the movies including copied voice lines. I was so disappointed there was no innovation at all of anything to look forward to story wise once I caught on. The missions were decent enough though with good simple puzzles and stuff so I still enjoyed my time doing those at least. I was annoyed that I couldn't even explore the map properly because you could only solve a bunch of challenges on a second playthrough. I'd only recommend if you want to play a LOTR themed collect-a-thon and want to focus on anything except the main story of the game. The Good +++ The exploration and puzzles are nice. Pretty much everywhere you look there's a little puzzle to solve or something to do, especially when not in a mission. Nice if you're into that. +++ Great when it leans into silly Lego stuff. My favorite parts are when the game leans into visual comedy with silly Lego jokes. Wish they did it more often. +++ A lot of side activities to do. If you like collecitng things and exploring an entire world for all its secrets, this game has you covered. ++ The missions were good enough. They did a good job keeping things varied with the puzzles and characters and how the missions played out. ++ It's still LOTR. The setting and characters are cool, because it's LOTR. The Bad - Combat is only 1 button press. It's quite boring, you press X and any enemy dies except bosses. Nothing interesting at play here for how often there is combat. - Managing all the characters is tedious. Especially in the first movie you control 9 people. They all have a unique skill that others can't do. Lot's of switching involved. - Time gated bosses were lame. As in, hit once, turn in circles for 2 minutes for the next \"hit window\", then hit again. Rince and repeat. -- Heavy Coop design. The game was clearly designed for co-op in mind and it was a bit annoying playing single player and seeing the co-op UI at all times or having a second character shoved in for co-op even when alone. If I plugged in my controller after launching the game I'd have to restart it cause it would only consider the controller a second player. -- All the fun of exploring is killed off. I stopped bothering to explore when I realise that in every mission and every area, all the fun puzzles to get collectibles are locked behind puzzles you can't solve with the main cast. You have to replay the whole game in free play once you're done to actually enjoy any of it, which I did not want to do. --- Copied the movie WAY too much. I'm new to Lego games, so I'm not sure what I was expecting. However, I wasn't expecting them to re-use dialogue pulled straight from the movies, in identical scenes, with identical camera work of all things. There was no surprise. It all played out exactly as in the movie, which was very disappointing to me. I feel like there was so much room to add a lot of Lego comedy and to re-interpret things while still following the same story.","title":"Lego Lord of the Rings"},{"location":"reviews/legolotr/#lego-lord-of-the-rings","text":"","title":"Lego Lord of the Rings"},{"location":"reviews/legolotr/#score-610","text":"","title":"Score: 6/10"},{"location":"reviews/legolotr/#playtime-10-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 10 hours"},{"location":"reviews/legolotr/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/legolotr/#storefront-steam","text":"Lego Lord of the Rings is, as the name implies, the Lego version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in game form.

As in, hit once, turn in circles for 2 minutes for the next \"hit window\", then hit again. Rince and repeat. -- Heavy Coop design. The game was clearly designed for co-op in mind and it was a bit annoying playing single player and seeing the co-op UI at all times or having a second character shoved in for co-op even when alone. If I plugged in my controller after launching the game I'd have to restart it cause it would only consider the controller a second player. -- All the fun of exploring is killed off. I stopped bothering to explore when I realise that in every mission and every area, all the fun puzzles to get collectibles are locked behind puzzles you can't solve with the main cast. You have to replay the whole game in free play once you're done to actually enjoy any of it, which I did not want to do. --- Copied the movie WAY too much. I'm new to Lego games, so I'm not sure what I was expecting. However, I wasn't expecting them to re-use dialogue pulled straight from the movies, in identical scenes, with identical camera work of all things. There was no surprise. It all played out exactly as in the movie, which was very disappointing to me. I feel like there was so much room to add a lot of Lego comedy and to re-interpret things while still following the same story.","title":"The Bad"},{"location":"reviews/marvelrivals/","text":"Marvel Rivals Score: 9/10 Playtime: 27 hours Platform: PC Storefront: Steam Marvel Rivals is the latest competitive objective based hero shooter only this time it is based on Marvel IP heroes and villains.

Final Opinion All things considered I like this game a lot. I can see msyelf playing it casually for quite some time. It plays really well and I enjoy a lot of the heroes. Just wish there were more maps. Would recommend. The Good ++++ The gameplay is fun and smooth. The biggest takeaway is that the characters feel good to play. The abilties are interesting and are rewarding to use, movement feels good and the maps are well designed. +++ Visual design is cool. The game has a good visual style that matches the comic book feel in my opinion. The characters and maps are very vibrant and flashy. +++ The menu is actually really nice. I think they did a great job with the individual hero pages having their own intros, plus you can see all the cosmetics for the hero in one place (looking at you R6) as well as lore stories. The career page is also very clear. Only the battlepass page could use some improvements. ++ Decent monetization. Worth noting that all heroes are free to play from the get go which is always appreciated. The battlepass does include a nice free skin and it was pretty cheap to unlock it as well (5 USD). No other loot boxes or weird monetization. ++ Smooth launch. I didn't have any major issues with bugs, crashes or performance during launch week at all. Pretty impressive. The Bad - Tanks are a bit lacking. Can't quite put my finger on why, but they don't feel as good to play as in Overwatch. Much ahrder to perform decently without constant heals. Notes - The spread of heroes could have been better. Twice as many DPS heroes as tanks or healers was a bit of an odd choice. Wish there were more of the other 2. - Not enough maps. With only 4 different maps I feel like I play the same setting too often.","title":"Marvel Rivals"},{"location":"reviews/marvelrivals/#marvel-rivals","text":"","title":"Marvel Rivals"},{"location":"reviews/marvelrivals/#score-910","text":"","title":"Score: 9/10"},{"location":"reviews/marvelrivals/#playtime-27-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 27 hours"},{"location":"reviews/marvelrivals/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/marvelrivals/#storefront-steam","text":"Marvel Rivals is the latest competitive objective based hero shooter only this time it is based on Marvel IP heroes and villains.

It has a very classic feel, very large maps with tons of secrets, bosses, enemies and the like. Its quite a fun action game and I'm happy I got to play it. There isn't much platforming (such as spike pits, spike wall, flying through tight spaces, etC) and focuses much more on combat and abilities to discover hidden areas. ++++ Looks fantastic. The game is gorgeous, easily its strongest point to me. The envrionments look very good and so do the enemies. Cutscenes are give or take but considering it's a Switch game theres only so much to do there. ++++ Map design is so good. Despite having 6 very large maps with hundreds of path, the game made sure the envrionments and configurations changed at every major point tonicely lead the player in the right direction. While some people enjoy the puzzle aspects of these types of games, where you have to search or remember which area was blocked that can now be opened, Dread is surprisingly linear. I appreciated that as getting lost and not knowing where to go is usually a big turn off for me. +++ Great progression with cool abilities. Every time I picked up the game, I managed to find at least an upgrade for my suit within a session. Getting new rockets, new suit resists, new bombs, etc. These help change up the gameplay and always open up new paths to keep you going. ++ Interesting boss battles. The major bosses encountered really pushed me to make use of all the abilities I had so far and were nice challenges compared to the easily disposable mobs found around the map. ++ Good map. A good map is always essential in these types of games. Important to show what kind of obstacle blocks each path, secrets, markers, etc. ++ Story was ok. I know nothing of Metroid lore whatsoever so that probably didn't help. Otherwise its a pretty simple \"escape the planet\" scenario and figure out why the big bad wants with you. Serviceable. - Frustrating switch controls. This is more to do with the Switch, and its not the first time I have issues with the control scheme (hello DBZ). A game like Metroid requires a lot of jumping and using multiple abilities to get to secrets or beat a boss and I found myself messing up often cause my fingers couldnt do the jump and hold another button for an attack while also shooting stuff all on one hand. - Reliance on counters / parry. This is also a general gaming trend I'm not particularly fond of. I've never enjoyed parry mechanics. I hate that waiting for the enemy to make a move is the correct play instead of just proactively using my attacks and abilities. Dread has a few bosses you absolutely have to parry, it also insta kills any mob enemy. Theres also a frustrating one where they want to enemy to be scary to be chased by it cause they are invulnerable, but can be parried for a stun.

It is a first person action survival horror game where you play as Ethan Winters, lost in a remote and ancient village somewhere in the Romanian countryside, trying to get back his daughter, Rose. The game starts with her and you being kidnapped and you waking up in the woods after the car of the kidnappers crashes. You then find yourself in a village watched over by strange beings, trying to find the answer to where Rose is. I will preface the good parts with the fact that I am usually not a fan of horror especially by myself, Dead Space being kind of the limit of spooky that I\u2019m willing to go to. That being said, this game blew me out of the water. This game toed the line between action and horror perfectly. I always felt like I was in control (except that 1 time in the dollhouse), that I could defend myself, and that if I died it was because I missed crucial shots and not because of a weird gimmick or something unexpected. Enemies are properly introduced and you get a good feel for the limits of your weapons and how to approach each situation. Secondly , they absolutely nailed the spooky atmosphere of an abandoned village in the middle of nowhere. Even in broad daylight I was on my toes thanks to the music, the world design, the sound effects and the constant ominous feeling looming over you that something awful was going to happen. This meant the game didn't really have to resort to cheap jump scares to keep you frightened. It helped that the game is super detailed and the textures are fantastic leading to a very realistic setting and believable world. Thirdly , the combat had weight. Every bullet mattered, no matter from which gun it was shot. They had appropriate impact, they felt good to use, and I was surprised at the amount of guns we got to use (around 8 I believe). On the flipside the enemies were all very cool and scary in their own right. There was a good balance of ammos / tools to enemies as well, meaning I wasn't afraid to use all my tools but also making sure none were wasted. The fourth great thing about this game was the exploration and map. I love a good map that tells me when I found everything that could be found in every room I explored. It made said exploration rewarding without dragging on cause I knew there was nothing left to find. The fifth great thing was the bosses. The game is quite distinctly separated in 5 zones each with their own atmosphere and boss that is super unique. Each one has an awesome fight that represented them well and an area that represented totally different types of horror. The last great thing about this game are the characters. They might not get much dialogue but most were really fleshed out and had a great personality (like Lady D.). I loved the Duke (the merchant) a lot and Heisenberg too. Honestly I couldn't find much I didn\u2019t enjoy about this game except the fact our protagonist Ethan is so dumb and has the worst one-liners evers, but it's also kind of funny at the same time. Overall , I give RE: Village my first 10 /10 of the year. I was honestly shocked at how much I enjoyed this game. I was looking forward to playing it every day. It was super engaging and there were always new elements being introduced to shake things up. The fighting was awesome. The atmosphere was superb. The setting and world were gorgeous. The sound design was just perfect (ok maybe picking items was a little too dramatic but otherwise it was good). The boss fights were fantastic and fun. The story was simple and straightforward. The characters were well thought out. Exploring was great. The horror was well built in. Just an overall amazing experience that was well paced and just the right length. Would recommend.

Simply put, you choose a character, choose a map, then slay hoardes of enemies coming at you indefinitely with weapons that automatically fire at set intervals. Your only input is moving around to pick up items and experience that make you level up and choose new weapons and upgrades. The Good ++++ The gameplay is so simple yet so compelling. Who would have though simply moving in 2D space would be so fun. The steady pogression from 1 weapon shooting once per second to 6 weapons obliterating everything on screen every microsecond is just pure dopamine. Survival in the early game is key and keeps it engaging until you reach your builds. Having to make choices often for each level that influence your build kept it interactive as well. ++++ The progression systems are perfect. I loved the easy list of achievements. It gave a clear goal for every run and showed mostly what would be unlocked every time. So even when youre easily blasting everything you have a goal to go for or a unique build to try. It also meant that after every run you usually had something new to try out to keep things fresh. Seeing the achievement list getting smaller and smaller as you go for 100% tingled my brain. ++++ Great selection of weapons. All the weapons in the game feel like they are viable. I think each are fun in their own way and have their place in one build or another. When boosted and upgraded they all look destructive and cool too. There are so many cool combos with Arcanas too. No two runs are alike. +++ The meta story progression was fun. There isn't REALLY a story in this game, but going through the main maps and then special maps searching for the next item that would allow you to unlock the next part was fun. Plus eventually defeating death and the final boss was very satisfying. ++ Good challenges and secrets. There are 14 secret characters to unlock at the end which I thought were fun challenges to do for powerful characters. ++ DLC maps are pretty cool. I really enjoyed the detailed map of Mt. Moonspell. Gave each run interesting places to go on the map. The Bad -- I think the UI could have been improved. Wish there was a way to access achievements from in-game, or even from the map screen since those are the main objectives. -- The game becomes too trivial near the end. Near the last 3rd of the game, every run becomes very straightforward once your understand all the best characters and combos. Plus some characters are legitimately invincible.

Who would have though simply moving in 2D space would be so fun. The steady pogression from 1 weapon shooting once per second to 6 weapons obliterating everything on screen every microsecond is just pure dopamine. Survival in the early game is key and keeps it engaging until you reach your builds. Having to make choices often for each level that influence your build kept it interactive as well. ++++ The progression systems are perfect. I loved the easy list of achievements. It gave a clear goal for every run and showed mostly what would be unlocked every time. So even when youre easily blasting everything you have a goal to go for or a unique build to try. It also meant that after every run you usually had something new to try out to keep things fresh. Seeing the achievement list getting smaller and smaller as you go for 100% tingled my brain. ++++ Great selection of weapons. All the weapons in the game feel like they are viable. I think each are fun in their own way and have their place in one build or another. When boosted and upgraded they all look destructive and cool too. There are so many cool combos with Arcanas too. No two runs are alike. +++ The meta story progression was fun. There isn't REALLY a story in this game, but going through the main maps and then special maps searching for the next item that would allow you to unlock the next part was fun.

This game was released in 2010 for PS3 originally and you can easily tell it has that classic old action style to it. Each mission has a time tracker at the end with bonus points for a fast clear, among other stats it uses. It also has no store, no skins, no items, no inventory or any other complimentary system. You get 3 guns and 2 grenades at all times, at a \u201cheat\u201d meter that limits your dashing speed boost, slo-mo near death time, and the laser gun weapon. You also have a really bad melee attack that instantly overheats you. That's the extent of the mechanics. There are 13 guns in total, all of which are actually pretty fun to use and different. When you pick up a weapon while you have max ammo with it already it upgrades to a slightly better version up to a maximum. There is basically no downtime in this game. You are always in some sort of action packed firefight zooming across with your boosts and trying to not die and that aspect is really fun. The enemies in the game are actually pretty varied. Beyond the small mob robots you have various deadlier super bots, enemy super suits, weird experiments, tanks, and giant death robots. The level design is surprisingly good for a game of this era. Lots of verticality and not too many reused areas despite being fairly linear and in an orbital colony that from above all looks the same. The story however is pretty lackluster and falls apart pretty quickly if you look at it too closely (like spending an entire arc saving some colonists because they could have intel on enemy positions but that info never comes up again and even if it did it makes no sense that hiding refugees would have anything useful). It definitely feels like Michael Bay could have come up with it. I will say the ending isn\u2019t awful though. There are plenty of neat cutscenes throughout though and those are alright. Overall, I rate Vanquish 8.5 /10. It's a fun action packed high octane shooter that never lets go of the pedal and lets you use a variety of cool weapons to lay waste to a horde of robots and giant mechs. The design is pretty good and the mechanics are simple and straightforward. However the story is forgettable and the game doesn't give you any new tools beyond the first hour to change things up but that's forgivable with its short playtime.

You play as one of the few remaining Na'Vi from a clan that was wiped by the RDA when you were children. They had captured the last few children to experiment upon but after a raid several years later you manage to escape. Your goal is (you guessed it) to unite the clans of the area and push the RDA out of the region. You fight across 3 distinct regions uniting 3 clans and defeating many RDA outposts and factories, completing world activiting, helping friends, and collecting a wide array of fauna and flora materials. Final Opinion Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a game I struggle to properly review. On one hand, I played this game a lot and never found it to be boring or a chore to do so. On the other hand, the game has a plethora of issues that I found really held it back from being great. I landed on a score of 8 because I had enough fun with it to do multiple DLCs and complete most of the world map. I also thought the story was serviceable and the biomes were a treat to explore. I could not gloss over all the issues this game had with all of it's supporting systems however. It felt like I had to fight against all the extra game systems (inventory, UI, gear, etc) to keep enjoing my moment to moment gameplay. I would only recommend this game to people who like the Ubisoft open world formula (such as Far Cry) and already love the world of Pandora (like me). Otherwise, the game systems will wear you down pretty quickly. The Good ++++ The world is obviously gorgeous as hell. Pandora is visually a really interesting world and I think Ubisoft did a great job at translating that in game. Environments has always been one of their strong suits. The photoluminescence at night, the multiple dozen unique biomes across the regions, the massive unique landscapes, were all cool to see especially from the ground. I also include here the huge diversity in plant and animal life. +++ The Na'vi felt authentic and true to the movies. The Na'vi had nice homes and outfits and behaved pretty much how I would expect them too. It was a good immersive experience combined with the environments. +++ Voice acting was good. I'm a sucker for fully voice acted games, always much preferred over the JRPG style of reading over half the stuff. I think they did a good job with the voice acting here. +++ Getting an ikran is dope. Doing a quest to get your own Ikran to fly around was one of my main hopes for this game and I was so happy it was included. Flying around was great. The 2nd DLC added a whole new skill tree to add more Ikran attacks and give it a mounted weapon and have it be more involved in combat as well. I wish so much I could have had those in base game it added so much more to combat for once. +++ Good DLC. The 2 DLCs added some very pretty maps (wide plains and a very vertical mountainous map), had better stories than base game, and good systems improvement especially the 2nd one. ++ Main story is decent. I'm pretty tolerant of stories. Even if it thread similar ground as the movies, its a good driver to explore the world. The stories of the DLC were even better I found too, with more interesting stakes. ++ I love the music. I've always enjoyed the music from the movies so I'm just happy we got more of it here in the game too, especially while flying around (even though it wouldn't always play like I would like). The Bad --- TOO MUCH RESSOURCE COLLECTING. Stop it Ubi. There's cooking materials, and weapon materials, and armor materials all with 4 different rarities. Any good crafting recipe requires high quality materials which are limited to a specific (vague) area of the map (for \"exquisite\" quality). Then for best values (because even an exquisite quality had a range of values it could produce) the materials need either clean kill for animals, or specific day / night or dry / rain (uncontrollable variables) for plants. Sure its more immersive, but becomes quickly annoying due to how often you're required to do this to keep up with gear. To make it worse by the end looted gear often ends up having better stats than the one you grinded materials for. I mostly gave up by the end but still some quests required you to craft certain things. Did I mention the first DLC added \"legendary\" materials that were super hard to come by and then locked the main story behind it? Yea. -- SIDE QUESTS ARE ALL TOO SAMEY. You either have to find some lost person (my son is lost, haven't seen my mom in years, find the lost healer, etc), collect some exquisite materials (make X dish for Y person, find Z rare plant), or take out a human base (which are exploration activities to do in the world already). All wrapped in some sad stories or lazyness (I broke my leg, I can't leave my son alone, I can't abandon camp). It's fine for a while, but by the third region the pattern was really starting to annoy me. -- The stupid hacking minigame. Again Ubi, just stop it. We get it, our character can use RDA tools and you guys couldn't find a more logical way for our protag to learn about RDA happenings than hacking every computer in sight using a dumb minigame where you just trace a path to the exit on some wires. Please for the love of god, just have it be hacked automatically. Its ok. I don't need to pretend I'm a l33t h4cker by doing some minigame to access the systems. Just make it happen automatically, or add an option in menu to skip them all. It was whatever the first 25 times, but by my 300th hack I was so god damn fed up every time you stopped my gameplay to make me do a 20s \"hack\" to progress the story. Stop it ubi. It's not fun. No one cares if something is insta-hacked I promise. -- Ubisoft simply sucks at making interesting and compelling characters. There are no epic cutscenes in this game, everything is rendered in-engine. The only time you get with characters is when you're talking to them and Ubisoft can't do more than wave their arms around a few times while standing still. MAKE THEM MOVE. People move while talking in the real world, they lean on things, they pick stuff up, they join you on quests. I don't know just make them feel alive, after 40h I could barely tell you the name of more than 1 other Na'vi. I will note that the DLC did a better job at this, and the animations improved and I knew a lot more characters well by then. - The combat is too linear. You have so few weapon options: Bow (short, long, heavy), gun (assault, shotgun), spear thrower (its like a bow, but not). First off, none of these are particularly interesting design wise (most bland human weapons possible, and I feel like the Na'vi could have innovated a bit beyond just a bow, like bolas or somesuch). Also notice how there are no melee weapons at all? You can only punch and kick, which as you can imagine just isn't effective or fun. So even when swarmed you gotta charge up every arrow to kill everyone. Which reminds me, all these bows and spear throwers have a wind up time which slows combat a lot, you can't do any quick moves. They TRIED to spice things up by giving every weapon a special ammo type (incendiary, electric, etc) but that had 2 problems. The first is those special ammo ALL REQUIRE A RARE RESSOURCE. THE SAME ONE. So I want fire arrows for my longbow well now I ran out of herbs to make the special ammo for my other weapons too. I could not be assed to farm for that specific ressource. Was not plentiful enough at all in the world. Secondly, nearly every enemy died in 1 hit. The optimal play every time is to stealth and 1 shot every enemy. All the mechs have weak points that neutralize them, animals have weak spots you MUST hit for a clean kill, humans all die in 1 hit from anything. So why bother with status effects and special ammo at all? Only a select few enemies had armored weakpoints that required a few more hits. Of course, if enemies are alerted and you can't hit the weakpoints its a different matter, but that wasn't the usual scenario until much later in the game where stealthing and weakpoint hits were a bit more challenging. -- Low enemy variety. There were humans (might have 3-4 different weapons), and bipedal mechs. Thats most of what you fought for the whole gaming barring a few animal predators here and there. The DLC improved on mech variety a lot which I appreciate. The third DLC (which I did not play) also seeemed like it added a ton of new enemies. -- INVENTORY. So now you must be thinking \"but Louis, can't you just buy the acrid pods for the special ammo instead? Or buy the food for the boring quests?\" YOU WOULD THINK SO. Alas, the vendors in this game only sell either blueprints to craft stuff, attachments for gear (which are uncraftable anyways), or a RANDOM assortment of mid to low tier materials (and only ever a single one of each). On top of this, your only currency is \"clan favor\" (gained from quests), which has a maximum cap and the good materials take a good chunk of favor. \"But Louis, sell your junk you surely accumulated by looting everything!\". No, you cannot sell anything to vendors. You have to find a \"community chest\" and dump your shit in there for a pittance of favor. Oh and pouches were limited to 50 in size. And you couldn't drop more than 10 things at your feet before the \"loot pickup\" was maxed and you had to move to drop it elsewhere. And the in-game \"stash\" also had a limit of 250 items. So for most of the game I was at max clan favor (with nothing to buy), so selling wasn't worthwhile, and my inventory was full, the stash was full, and dropping stuff was annoying. Kind of breaks the whole loot system and made interacting with it not worth it. The only thing that COULD have been worth buying, attachments (uncraftable), were made pointless by the fact that they just gave boring, useless stat bonuses such as: +9% RDA damage, +12% stealth damage, +10% speed while low on health, +5% mounted damage (remember everything is 1 shot anyways). I will note, the DLC made attachments much better and worthwhile to use. The whole inventory / vendor / currency / stash loop was just fundamentally broken. It desperatly needed a \"sell junk\" button and a currency that didn't have a limit. - Mounted combat. Besides your Ikran, you could also ride the Direhorses! Thats fun right, traveling fast while seeing the landscape from the ground. Except of course, you can't call one on command like your Ikran, and they are only found in 1/3 of the map, and aren't found near fast travel points, and need to be \"soothed\" before riding (which can fail). So yea, I never actually rode a horse except for the story quest as you can imagine. I will note this was fixed in the first DLC, and there were horses at every relevant fast travel point, or something to call one already soothed, which is a good improvement. - My wishlist. Having said all of this, heres my thoughts on what I think they should have done to raise the bar a little. Firstly, a good melee weapon. This game desperatly needed a faster weapon that was quick to use and felt like it did ok damage. Its fine if it's less than bow and can't hit weakpoints as well, but sometimes charging shots while the flamethrower mech is in your face just felt wrong. My second wish was more side quests that showcased the world. I wanted more quests that led to gorgeous vistas or unique locations. More quests that made you fight super strong predators in cool natural arenas (they were so close with legendary animal materials but they just didn't make cooler fights). Things that really showcase how cool Pandora can be.","title":"Avatar Frontiers of Pandora"},{"location":"reviews/2025/avatarfrontiers/#avatar-frontiers-of-pandora","text":"","title":"Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora"},{"location":"reviews/2025/avatarfrontiers/#score-810","text":"","title":"Score: 8/10"},{"location":"reviews/2025/avatarfrontiers/#playtime-90-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 90 hours"},{"location":"reviews/2025/avatarfrontiers/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/2025/avatarfrontiers/#storefront-ubisoft-connect","text":"Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a first person action adventure game set on Pandora, the world from the Avatar movies.

More quests that made you fight super strong predators in cool natural arenas (they were so close with legendary animal materials but they just didn't make cooler fights). Things that really showcase how cool Pandora can be.","title":"The Bad"},{"location":"reviews/2025/balatro/","text":"Balatro Score: 8.5/10 Playtime: 60 hours Platform: PC Storefront: Steam Balatro is a pretty unique rogue-lite card game that uses the typical 52-card deck and classic poker hands as the basis for its gameplay. You goal is to play high scoring poker hands to beat the minimum score of each blind (round) and to play around negative modifiers of the boss blind round. As you move up the rounds you get to buy jokers which help in all aspects of play from economy to score multiplying. You can also purchase cards and upgrade the base score of your poker hands in the shops between rounds. There is no other major goal beyond unlocking every joker (achievements) and decks. Final Opinion My final opinion of Balatro is that its absolutely amazing at grabbing you attention and pulling you into its fun and crazy deckbuilding, but it realy falls flat at keeping things interesting in the long term. The best parts are where you are continuously discovering new builds, new jokers, and new playstyles with different decks. It slowly starts to unravel though as you realise a lot of the given options are simply bad and never worth taking and you start going for the same builds more often to help secure the win. I wish there was more pre-run customization or upgrades and more goals beyond beating round 8 for every single run. The slow build up of powers made the first half of every run just feel way too similar. All that being said, the core gameplay is still really fun and I'm glad I played it. I recommend playing it, but don't expect to find some massively replayable game. The Good ++++ The sound design is legit fire. The little sound effects when cards get scored give pure dopamine hits especially when the score multiplier goes high. Very well done. ++++ Great core gameplay design. What can I say, rogue-lite deckbuilding poker game is just fun. Theres a great gameplay loop here with scoring hands and upgrading the deck. +++ Nice art and retro style. A lot of art was made for all the jokers and card styles that are well done. I enjoyed the retro style of the game a lot. +++ Great deckbuilding options. I liked that every card could have a type (foil, holo, poly, negative, etc) as well and other offects stacked on like stickers. I also enjoyed the wide variety of jokers, and the concept of Tarot / Spectral cards. There were lots of angles to upgrade your run. The Bad -- Early game of each run were too similar. Especially at higher difficulties, it could take up to half the run to start having an interesting deck. Combined with only 1 pre-run customizable option (your deck choice) it got pretty stale. Same scaling upgrades would help makes those higher rounds become more feasable objectives. -- A lack of interesting objectives. Sure making points go up was fun for a while, but I wish there had been something else to change up the gameplay. The boss blind debuffs weren't enough. Nothing to unlock besides 9 decks also means once you have them all theres just nothing to play for in the end.","title":"Balatro"},{"location":"reviews/2025/balatro/#balatro","text":"","title":"Balatro"},{"location":"reviews/2025/balatro/#score-8510","text":"","title":"Score: 8.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/2025/balatro/#playtime-60-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 60 hours"},{"location":"reviews/2025/balatro/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/2025/balatro/#storefront-steam","text":"Balatro is a pretty unique rogue-lite card game that uses the typical 52-card deck and classic poker hands as the basis for its gameplay.

You drive around fishing a variety of marine life for money, upgrades, quests and achievements. The story revolves around collecting 4 mysterious artifacts that were lost at the bottom of the sea for some stranger. You have to be weary of your sanity at night as the darkness makes it drop and dangerous creatures come out. Final Opinion In the end I think Dredge is a fine game. I enjoyed collecting all the fish as if I was filling out a Pokedex and pimping out my boat. The horror elements were fun and kept the gameplay from being too one-note. The art style and visual design were very unique and it gave the game an interesting appeal. I just wish all the islands had a more distinct gameplay feel to them. Couldn't help but feel like I had mapped out the entire game after finishing the first island since they all had a similar structure and the game was made so you could do them in any order. I did end up with the impression I was just going through the motions near the end which is a shame. I think the DLC does help adress this but I didn't play them. The Good ++++ Distinct visual style. The drawn comic style of the characters and general feel of the world were very cool. I always appreciate games doing unique visual approaches. ++++ The fish Pokedex is fun. I'm a sucker for collecting things. The journal presented all the found fish in a fun and easy to sort way that make the collecting enjoyable. +++ The world biomes were great. One of the highlights was always reaching a new island to see its style, unique fish, and particular gimmick. They made them all very interesting. ++ Sanity was a good trade-off. It never stopped you from doing anything but it gave interesting decision making regarding night time fishing and using your eldritch abilities. The Bad - Gameplay nitpicks. Too many non-connecting menus in towns. Just let me do all the repairing, purchasing, and selling from one place instead of going back and forth between 3 shops. I also found most sidequests to be particularly useless as book rewards were barely worth it. - Time goes by too fast. Night arrives too fast (forcing retreat to some extend). This made fishing in remote locations extremely tedious due to constant back and forth between dock and fishing spot. -- Each island had the same flow. One of my biggest issues. Each island revolved around 1 specific quest that would open up a particular fishing spot that would give the main quest McGuffin. Nothing else really mattered in the game.

You still play as Jack, a ghostunner, as you fight an AI cult trying to fill in the power vacuum. You still die instantly if you take any damage so you have to use your abilities wisely in every encounter to defeat all the enemies. There is still a heavy emphasis on platforming with wall runs, dashes, grappling hooks and more. You still have your trusty Katana to one-hit kill most enemies as well. The twist for this installement is the addition of the speed bike. You'll have a few levels where you get to ride it around and do some cool tricks with it. Final Opinion Ghostrunner II is a good sequel in my opinion. It keeps most of what made the first game really fun, and built upon it with some extra systems and abilities. The gameplay is still very tight and reminiscent of Neon White with mission times, extra quick retries to optimize, and fast pace dashing around. I also realy liked the addition of the bike itself, and thought the related missions were cool even if a bit over-the-top silly. While other parts of the game like the story and NPCs and even the ability tree were a bit lacking, it is clear most of the love went into making the moment to moment gameplay extremely compelling. The animations and effects were with any combat related thing were very well done. Overall, its a niche genre but if you enjoyed the first installment, you'll certainly enjoy this one as well (except maybe the bike which is a hot topic). The Good ++++ Clean platforming. You're always on the move in this game and the maps are well designed to make full use of all your abilities and make traversal interesting. Combat encounters also give you plenty of freedom to dash around in whatever way you want to clear the enemies. ++++ Solid combat wih good enemy variety. Having a lot of enemies means using all your tools to defeat them as they all require a different approach. Its fast, and the hits feel good. Cool executes as well. Makes you properly feel like a cyber ninja with the Katana and shurikens. +++ Banger soundtrack. Self explanatory, good music. +++ The speed bike is great. Does it drive like shit? Yes. Is it clunky as fuck? Also yes. Does it get stuck on every bit of environment? yup. Did I get to drive down the insides of a metal wurm at 200 kph while avoiding lasers, gears, and metal spikes to jump out of its mouth while it explodes behind me like a total badass? Absolutely. ++ Story was alright. It did its job to motivate the player, but thats about it. The Bad - Stiff NPCS. It feels like its a bit stuck 10 years in the past here. The NPC's barely lift their heads when you talk to them and gives a very lifeless impression compared to more recent games. - Ability tree kinda pointless. You can upgrade some of your abilities with a system of memory cores and such. However it kind of felt too complexe for its own good as the upgrades never really felt relevant. Game was entirely playable and enjoyable with the base version of every ability. Probably just a reason to find collectables around the maps. - Clunky open world. At some point you go outside and do a few missions in an open-world-ish map. Traversal is clunky at best with the bike, and getting the collectables is annoying in this zone. - Some cybervoid levels did kind of drag on.

There is a small overarching plot about saving humanity and specific invasions but most of the game focuses on the missions you dive into which are 20-40 minute long sessions which you can do solo or up to 4 players. You complete objectives around the map and extract before losing all your lives. You collect ressources on those missions to upgrade your ship and your stratagems, which are special or limited weapons / aerial attacks that you can use in missions. Final Opinion As of writing this, Helldivers 2 is still in a weird limbo for me. I feel like I haven't really played enough to appreciate all the game has to offer, but I also kind of stopped playing for now. By all accounts it has everything in it that hits the fun parts of my brain like giant mechas / creatures, huge guns and explosives, giant lasers, epic fights. I feel like my frustration came from the solo experience being too difficult / long, and the muliplayer experience to be a bit too disjointed. I may have put the game down for now but I do hope to revisit it someday. The Good ++++ Badass enemies. The enemies in this game are deadly, they are varied, they have very cool huge units that are awesome to fight and to take down. ++++ Insane arsenal. One of the most unqiue arsenals I've had the pleasure of using in most of my gaming history. Orbital strikes, lasers from space, rocket turrets on call, guided launchers, carpet bombs.. the list goes on. These are awesome. ++ Cool customization. Lots of good free options to modify the look of our helldiver. Plus all the ordonance choices and weapon loadouts. ++ Sound design. Using the ordonance and killing enemies all have very satisfying sounds. The Bad -- Too easy to get lost in maps. I get it, actual warzones don't exactly have lots of landmarks, but the endless mars-like landscape got me confused so many times. Maybe the map just wasn't intuitive enough for me yet due to little play time but I was getting lost more often than I'd like. -- Solo play was too hard. I know, theres 10 levels of difficulty so this really shouldn't be an issue. I wanted do to higher difficulty stuff though, and alone it could be really challenging to break through some areas or get around without dying. The issue was also that finishing objetives solo was much slower for already long sessions. -- Multiplayer was disjointed. My issue here is that non of the objectives actually felt coolaborative. Everyone kinda loaded in and just f'ed off and did their own thing until all obejctives were done and everyone rejoined for extraction. This highlighted again my solo issues since I felt solo even with 3 other squadmates. Even with friends it was tempting to just go do your own thing. Lastly, and this is a personal issue, in multiplayer I felt I couldn't use my fun tools cause everyone who knew more what they were doing already went ahead and use the carpet bomb, nuke, laser on the threat or outpost that needed it. Leaving me feeling like my only options were sub-par uses just to feel like I used it, or to seperate myself to do the fun things on my own.

Final Opinion This was simply a stunning game. The visuals were constantly blowing me away which made it exciting to keep discovering every new zone. I thought the combat flowed really well despite its simplicity (enemy variance helped). I particularly loved the dream sequence and winter season, they had the most striking visuals and better puzzles (mouth teleporters and mirroring).
