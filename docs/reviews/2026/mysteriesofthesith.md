**Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Mysteries of the Sith** is basically a story sequel to one of my most cherished games of all time. It is an old school action FPS with some lightsaber combat sprinkled in. There are 14 missions were you play as both Kyle Katarn and Mara Jade trying to find a Sith Temple while avoiding and sabotaging the empire. Every level has a bunch of secrets and you get more force powers as the game progresses as well.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
I simply love this series with a passion and this game is no different. I was so thrilled when I discovered there was an sequel I had never heard about and was available on GOG for 2$. The gameplay brought me right back and it was just as great as I remember with the unique guns and all the secrets to find all over the levels. There are were some cool new enemies in this one and less restriction on which force powers to use. I was however disappointed there weren't any fully acted live action cutscenes like the original which is a huge part of what made it special, and in general the levels weren't quite as memorable except for a select few. Still, I had a ton of fun with this and was happy I played it.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ Amazing sound design.** A huge part of the nostalgia for me is all the unique and extremely recognizable sound effects for every action. The sound for picking up shields, the sound of using a bacta, the sound of the concussive rifle blast, even the screams of death. I'd recognize these in 20 years even if I never heard them again. So good.<br/>
**+++ Secret hunting is fun.** Theres something about old school games and their secret that just doesn't exist in the same way in modern games. I enjoyed hunting for them and finding them all.<br/>
**+++ The new weapons were good gameplay additions.** While it had all the same ones as the first, it added new variants like a sniper and heat seeking missiles which were really cool. Plus the designs are neat.<br/>
**++ New enemies were a good challenge.** The game added murder sith wolves, force zombies and saber wielding statues. These were all pretty challenging to fight and a good addition.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**-- No acted cutscenes was a big loss.** Let's just say in-engine cutscenes from 1997 don't exactly look the best. <br/>
**- A couple of levels were pretty frustrating.** Particularly the swamp level and one of the first asteroid ones. A bit confusing and hard to understand the objectives.<br/>
