**Shogun Showdown** is a turn base rogue like game with a small "deckbuilding" element to its combat system. The rules are simple, play on a 5 to 10 case 2d grid and defeat all the enemy waves that spawn in. Defeat them by preparing attacks and executing them on a turn by turn basis. Between each round you get to upgrade your gear or purchase some consumables in shops. There are 5 islands to clear each rounded off with a boss  fight until you reach the Shogun. Each time you beat him you unlock an extra diffculty (new day) and beat him on the hardest difficulty (day 7) to clear the game. There are 5 playable starting characters each with a unique mobility ability and a different pair of starting weapon cards.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
This game a was little surprising for me as I didnt expect to like it as much based purely on the trailer. However the combat and strategy involved especailly at higher difficulties really tickled my brain nicely and I had a good time trying to find the perfect combo to beat the highest difficulty. Moving enemies to make them hit each other, collision damage and teleporting were some really fun mechanics to master. I thought the art style was pretty cute as well. The weapon and skill variety was nice to see, very rarely had runs that felt repetitive unless they ended sortly. I must say I wish there were a few more permanent upgrades to get in-between runs or island choices to avoid having too similar starts between runs. Since all weapons can be used by any character, the moment I beat the game with one, most of my motivation to play left with it. There is too little difference to warrant trying to beat the day 7 shogun with all characters before it becomes extremely reptitive and tedious.<br/>


#### **The Good**
**++++ Great Combat depth.** The main appeal of this game, the combat system, is also it's main strength. There is a lot of strategy between queuing actions, waiting for spawns, manipulating positions, managing cooldowns and effects, baiting actions, and more.<br/>
**+++ Cute art style.** It's a nice little indie look that had a certain charm to it.<br/>
**+++ Good sound design and music.** The sound effects added some nice weight to attacks, and the sound trackwas good. <br/>
**+++ Good skill and weapon variety.** Super important for this type of game and they nailed it. <br/>
**++  A few good character options.** Not a whole lot of them, but they had distinct gimmicks. <br/>

#### **The Bad**
**-- Early game too samey.** Every run starts the same way. Even if extra difficulties make deep runs pretty varied, the start quickly becomes a chore until you get a lot of upgrades. <br/>
**-- Needed more upgrades that modified runs.** The only unlockables were weapons and skills. That's nice, but it doesn't change the core experience in any way, especially since ever map plays out the exact same every single time.<br/>
