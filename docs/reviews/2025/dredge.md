**Dredge** is a little fishing adventure game where you control a small fishing boat in strange lands. You drive around fishing a variety of marine life for money, upgrades, quests and achievements. The story revolves around collecting 4 mysterious artifacts that were lost at the bottom of the sea for some stranger. You have to be weary of your sanity at night as the darkness makes it drop and dangerous creatures come out.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
In the end I think Dredge is a fine game. I enjoyed collecting all the fish as if I was filling out a Pokedex and pimping out my boat. The horror elements were fun and kept the gameplay from being too one-note. The art style and visual design were very unique and it gave the game an interesting appeal. I just wish all the islands had a more distinct gameplay feel to them. Couldn't help but feel like I had mapped out the entire game after finishing the first island since they all had a similar structure and the game was made so you could do them in any order. I did end up with the impression I was just going through the motions near the end which is a shame. I think the DLC does help adress this but I didn't play them.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ Distinct visual style.** The drawn comic style of the characters and general feel of the world were very cool. I always appreciate games doing unique visual approaches.<br/>
**++++ The fish Pokedex is fun.** I'm a sucker for collecting things. The journal presented all the found fish in a fun and easy to sort way that make the collecting enjoyable.<br/>
**+++ The world biomes were great.** One of the highlights was always reaching a new island to see its style, unique fish, and particular gimmick. They made them all very interesting. <br/>
**++ Sanity was a good trade-off.** It never stopped you from doing anything but it gave interesting decision making regarding night time fishing and using your eldritch abilities.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**- Gameplay nitpicks.** Too many non-connecting menus in towns. Just let me do all the repairing, purchasing, and selling from one place instead of going back and forth between 3 shops. I also found most sidequests to be particularly useless as book rewards were barely worth it.<br/>
**- Time goes by too fast.** Night arrives too fast (forcing retreat to some extend). This made fishing in remote locations extremely tedious due to constant back and forth between dock and fishing spot.<br/>
**-- Each island had the same flow.** One of my biggest issues. Each island revolved around 1 specific quest that would open up a particular fishing spot that would give the main quest McGuffin. Nothing else really mattered in the game. Only reason it took longer was constant fishing to upgrade the boat.<br/>
