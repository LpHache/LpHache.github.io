I will not write a complete review of Warframe as is it simply a 12 year old live service action game with about a million difference systems working together, and this year was a return to it for me and not my first time playing it. I will simply say that I absolutely love this game for the design aspect of all the frames and the fun it is to try and collect every single frame out there. It has consumed way too much of my time this year but I had a ton of fun with it. <br/>
