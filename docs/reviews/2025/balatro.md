**Balatro** is a pretty unique rogue-lite card game that uses the typical 52-card deck and classic poker hands as the basis for its gameplay. You goal is to play high scoring poker hands to beat the minimum score of each blind (round) and to play around negative modifiers of the boss blind round. As you move up the rounds you get to buy jokers which help in all aspects of play from economy to score multiplying. You can also purchase cards and upgrade the base score of your poker hands in the shops between rounds. There is no other major goal beyond unlocking every joker (achievements) and decks.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
My final opinion of Balatro is that its absolutely amazing at grabbing you attention and pulling you into its fun and crazy deckbuilding, but it realy falls flat at keeping things interesting in the long term. The best parts are where you are continuously discovering new builds, new jokers, and new playstyles with different decks. It slowly starts to unravel though as you realise a lot of the given options are simply bad and never worth taking and you start going for the same builds more often to help secure the win. I wish there was more pre-run customization or upgrades and more goals beyond beating round 8 for every single run. The slow build up of powers made the first half of every run just feel way too similar. All that being said, the core gameplay is still really fun and I'm glad I played it. I recommend playing it, but don't expect to find some massively replayable game.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ The sound design is legit fire.** The little sound effects when cards get scored give pure dopamine hits especially when the score multiplier goes high. Very well done.<br/>
**++++ Great core gameplay design.** What can I say, rogue-lite deckbuilding poker game is just fun. Theres a great gameplay loop here with scoring hands and upgrading the deck.<br/>
**+++ Nice art and retro style.** A lot of art was made for all the jokers and card styles that are well done. I enjoyed the retro style of the game a lot.<br/>
**+++ Great deckbuilding options.** I liked that every card could have a type (foil, holo, poly, negative, etc) as well and other offects stacked on like stickers. I also enjoyed the wide variety of jokers, and the concept of Tarot / Spectral cards. There were lots of angles to upgrade your run.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**-- Early game of each run were too similar.** Especially at higher difficulties, it could take up to half the run to start having an interesting deck. Combined with only 1 pre-run customizable option (your deck choice) it got pretty stale. Same scaling upgrades would help makes those higher rounds become more feasable objectives.<br/>
**-- A lack of interesting objectives.** Sure making points go up was fun for a while, but I wish there had been something else to change up the gameplay. The boss blind debuffs weren't enough. Nothing to unlock besides 9 decks also means once you have them all theres just nothing to play for in the end.<br/>
