**Helldivers 2** is a third person cooperative action shooter where you play as soldiers on the front line pushing back against an endless invading for or robots, zergs, and strange alien foes. There is a small overarching plot about saving humanity and specific invasions but most of the game focuses on the missions you dive into which are 20-40 minute long sessions which you can do solo or up to 4 players. You complete objectives around the map and extract before losing all your lives. You collect ressources on those missions to upgrade your ship and your stratagems, which are special or limited weapons / aerial attacks that you can use in missions.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
As of writing this, Helldivers 2 is still in a weird limbo for me. I feel like I haven't really played enough to appreciate all the game has to offer, but I also kind of stopped playing for now. By all accounts it has everything in it that hits the fun parts of my brain like giant mechas / creatures, huge guns and explosives, giant lasers, epic fights. I feel like my frustration came from the solo experience being too difficult / long, and the muliplayer experience to be a bit too disjointed. I may have put the game down for now but I do hope to revisit it someday.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ Badass enemies.** The enemies in this game are deadly, they are varied, they have very cool huge units that are awesome to fight and to take down.<br/>
**++++ Insane arsenal.** One of the most unqiue arsenals I've had the pleasure of using in most of my gaming history. Orbital strikes, lasers from space, rocket turrets on call, guided launchers, carpet bombs.. the list goes on. These are awesome.<br/>
**++ Cool customization.** Lots of good free options to modify the look of our helldiver. Plus all the ordonance choices and weapon loadouts.<br/>
**++ Sound design.** Using the ordonance and killing enemies all have very satisfying sounds.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**-- Too easy to get lost in maps.** I get it, actual warzones don't exactly have lots of landmarks, but the endless mars-like landscape got me confused so many times. Maybe the map just wasn't intuitive enough for me yet due to little play time but I was getting lost more often than I'd like.<br/>
**-- Solo play was too hard.** I know, theres 10 levels of difficulty so this really shouldn't be an issue. I wanted do to higher difficulty stuff though, and alone it could be really challenging to break through some areas or get around without dying. The issue was also that finishing objetives solo was much slower for already long sessions.<br/>
**-- Multiplayer was disjointed.** My issue here is that non of the objectives actually felt coolaborative. Everyone kinda loaded in and just f'ed off and did their own thing until all obejctives were done and everyone rejoined for extraction. This highlighted again my solo issues since I felt solo even with 3 other squadmates. Even with friends it was tempting to just go do your own thing. Lastly, and this is a personal issue, in multiplayer I felt I couldn't use my fun tools cause everyone who knew more what they were doing already went ahead and use the carpet bomb, nuke, laser on the threat or outpost that needed it. Leaving me feeling like my only options were sub-par uses just to feel like I used it, or to seperate myself to do the fun things on my own. I'm not sure how to beter explain the feeling.<br/>
