**Neva** is a 2D action platformer where you explore a dying world with your lovely little wolf companion (Neva) throughout four seasons. In classic platformer fashion you jump, dash and strike through the world solving simple enough puzzles to progress. Each season seas your pet wolf grow and change, gaining new abilities to switch up the gamplay. Connecting it all together is an underlying story of loss, love, and friendship.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
This was simply a stunning game. The visuals were constantly blowing me away which made it exciting to keep discovering every new zone. I thought the combat flowed really well despite its simplicity (enemy variance helped). I particularly loved the dream sequence and winter season, they had the most striking visuals and better puzzles (mouth teleporters and mirroring). Would highly recommend to anyone for a great little experience in under 5h if they enjoy 2D platforming in the slighest.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ The art style is outstanding.** From the soft watercolor nature blend in the early seasons to hard edges and contrasting colors iin the darker sections, this game never stopped amazing me. It had glorious set pieces and evoked a lot of emotions through its style and presentation alone.<br/>
**++++ Gameplay never stopped being interesting.** It's a short game, but it managed to introduce something new around every corner. Wether that was a new way to move around, to attack, a level gimmick, or anything else, I never got bored of exploring the setting.<br/>
**+++ Simple, but emotional story.** There isn't much dialogue in the game beyond calling for Neva, but nonetheless it does an amazing job at making you feel a lot of emotions purely through visuals, music, and setting.<br/>
**++ All the nice extras.** Its short and sweet at 4h. Its easy to get 100% achievements. It runs smooth like butter.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**- It starts a bit slow.** My only gripe is that the first 30ish minutes felt a bit slower as it's the usual introduction of all basic game mechanics and Neva has no powers yet. It was also my least favorite season, visually (while still gorgeous mind you).<br/>
