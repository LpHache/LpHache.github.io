**Ghostunner II** is a cyberpunk themed first person action slasher / platformer that is a direct sequel to the first game. You still play as Jack, a ghostunner, as you fight an AI cult trying to fill in the power vacuum. You still die instantly if you take any damage so you have to use your abilities wisely in every encounter to defeat all the enemies. There is still a heavy emphasis on platforming with wall runs, dashes, grappling hooks and more. You still have your trusty Katana to one-hit kill most enemies as well. The twist for this installement is the addition of the speed bike. You'll have a few levels where you get to ride it around and do some cool tricks with it.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
Ghostrunner II is a good sequel in my opinion. It keeps most of what made the first game really fun, and built upon it with some extra systems and abilities. The gameplay is still very tight and reminiscent of Neon White with mission times, extra quick retries to optimize, and fast pace dashing around. I also realy liked the addition of the bike itself, and thought the related missions were cool even if a bit over-the-top silly. While other parts of the game like the story and NPCs and even the ability tree were a bit lacking, it is clear most of the love went into making the moment to moment gameplay extremely compelling. The animations and effects were with any combat related thing were very well done. Overall, its a niche genre but if you enjoyed the first installment, you'll certainly enjoy this one as well (except maybe the bike which is a hot topic).<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ Clean platforming.** You're always on the move in this game and the maps are well designed to make full use of all your abilities and make traversal interesting. Combat encounters also give you plenty of freedom to dash around in whatever way you want to clear the enemies.<br/>
**++++ Solid combat wih good enemy variety.** Having a lot of enemies means using all your tools to defeat them as they all require a different approach. Its fast, and the hits feel good. Cool executes as well. Makes you properly feel like a cyber ninja with the Katana and shurikens. <br/>
**+++ Banger soundtrack.** Self explanatory, good music.<br/>
**+++ The speed bike is great.** Does it drive like shit? Yes. Is it clunky as fuck? Also yes. Does it get stuck on every bit of environment? yup. Did I get to drive down the insides of a metal wurm at 200 kph while avoiding lasers, gears, and metal spikes to jump out of its mouth while it explodes behind me like a total badass? Absolutely. <br/>
**++ Story was alright.** It did its job to motivate the player, but thats about it.<br/>


#### **The Bad**
**- Stiff NPCS.** It feels like its a bit stuck 10 years in the past here. The NPC's barely lift their heads when you talk to them and gives a very lifeless impression compared to more recent games.<br/>
**- Ability tree kinda pointless.** You can upgrade some of your abilities with a system of memory cores and such. However it kind of felt too complexe for its own good as the upgrades never really felt relevant. Game was entirely playable and enjoyable with the base version of every ability. Probably just a reason to find collectables around the maps.<br/>
**- Clunky open world.** At some point you go outside and do a few missions in an open-world-ish map. Traversal is clunky at best with the bike, and getting the collectables is annoying in this zone.<br/>
**- Some cybervoid levels did kind of drag on.** I much preferred the regular world levels (more visually interesting) so going into the cybervoid a lot got annoying.<br/>
