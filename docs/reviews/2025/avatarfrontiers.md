**Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora** is a first person action adventure game set on Pandora, the world from the Avatar movies. You play as one of the few remaining Na'Vi from a clan that was wiped by the RDA when you were children. They had captured the last few children to experiment upon but after a raid several years later you manage to escape. Your goal is (you guessed it) to unite the clans of the area and push the RDA out of the region. You fight across 3 distinct regions uniting 3 clans and defeating many RDA outposts and factories, completing world activiting, helping friends, and collecting a wide array of fauna and flora materials.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a game I struggle to properly review. On one hand, I played this game a lot and never found it to be boring or a chore to do so. On the other hand, the game has a plethora of issues that I found really held it back from being great. I landed on a score of 8 because I had enough fun with it to do multiple DLCs and complete most of the world map. I also thought the story was serviceable and the biomes were a treat to explore. I could not gloss over all the issues this game had with all of it's supporting systems however. It felt like I had to fight against all the extra game systems (inventory, UI, gear, etc) to keep enjoing my moment to moment gameplay. I would only recommend this game to people who like the Ubisoft open world formula (such as Far Cry) and already love the world of Pandora (like me). Otherwise, the game systems will  wear you down pretty quickly.

#### **The Good**
**++++ The world is obviously gorgeous as hell.** Pandora is visually a really interesting world and I think Ubisoft did a great job at translating that in game. Environments has always been one of their strong suits. The photoluminescence at night, the multiple dozen unique biomes across the regions, the massive unique landscapes, were all cool to see especially from the ground. I also include here the huge diversity in plant and animal life.<br/>
**+++ The Na'vi felt authentic and true to the movies.** The Na'vi had nice homes and outfits and behaved pretty much how I would expect them too. It was a good immersive experience combined with the environments. <br/>
**+++ Voice acting was good.** I'm a sucker for fully voice acted games, always much preferred over the JRPG style of reading over half the stuff. I think they did a good job with the voice acting here. <br/>
**+++ Getting an ikran is dope.** Doing a quest to get your own Ikran to fly around was one of my main hopes for this game and I was so happy it was included. Flying around was great. The 2nd DLC added a whole new skill tree to add more Ikran attacks and give it a mounted weapon and have it be more involved in combat as well. I wish so much I could have had those in base game it added so much more to combat for once.<br/>
**+++ Good DLC.** The 2 DLCs added some very pretty maps (wide plains and a very vertical mountainous map), had better stories than base game, and good systems improvement especially the 2nd one.
**++ Main story is decent.** I'm pretty tolerant of stories. Even if it thread similar ground as the movies, its a good driver to explore the world. The stories of the DLC were even better I found too, with more interesting stakes.<br/>
**++ I love the music.** I've always enjoyed the music from the movies so I'm just happy we got more of it here in the game too, especially while flying around (even though it wouldn't always play like I would like).<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**--- TOO MUCH RESSOURCE COLLECTING.** Stop it Ubi. There's cooking materials, and weapon materials, and armor materials all with 4 different rarities. Any good crafting recipe requires high quality materials which are limited to a specific (vague) area of the map (for "exquisite" quality). Then for best values (because even an exquisite quality had a range of values it could produce) the materials need either clean kill for animals, or specific day / night or dry / rain (uncontrollable variables)  for plants. Sure its more immersive, but becomes quickly annoying due to how often you're required to do this to keep up with gear. To make it worse by the end looted gear often ends up having better stats than the one you grinded materials for. I mostly gave up by the end but still some quests required you to craft certain things. Did I mention the first DLC added "legendary" materials that were super hard to come by and then locked the main story behind it? Yea.<br/>
**-- SIDE QUESTS ARE ALL TOO SAMEY.** You either have to find some lost person (my son is lost, haven't seen my mom in years, find the lost healer, etc), collect some exquisite materials (make X dish for Y person, find Z rare plant), or take out a human base (which are exploration activities to do in the world already). All wrapped in some sad stories or lazyness (I broke my leg, I can't leave my son alone, I can't abandon camp). It's fine for a while, but by the third region the pattern was really starting to annoy me. <br/>
**-- The stupid hacking minigame.** Again Ubi, just stop it. We get it, our character can use RDA tools and you guys couldn't find a more logical way for our protag to learn about RDA happenings than hacking every computer in sight using a dumb minigame where you just trace a path to the exit on some wires. Please for the love of god, just have it be hacked automatically. Its ok. I don't need to pretend I'm a l33t h4cker by doing some minigame to access the systems. Just make it happen automatically, or add an option in menu to skip them all. It was whatever the first 25 times, but by my 300th hack I was so god damn fed up every time you stopped my gameplay to make me do a 20s "hack" to progress the story. Stop it ubi. It's not fun. No one cares if something is insta-hacked I promise. <br/>
**-- Ubisoft simply sucks at making interesting and compelling characters.** There are no epic cutscenes in this game, everything is rendered in-engine. The only time you get with characters is when you're talking to them and Ubisoft can't do more than wave their arms around a few times while standing still. MAKE THEM MOVE. People move while talking in the real world, they lean on things, they pick stuff up, they join you on quests. I don't know just make them feel alive, after 40h I could barely tell you the name of more than 1 other Na'vi. I will note that the DLC did a better job at this, and the animations improved and I knew a lot more characters well by then.<br/>
**- The combat is too linear.** You have so few weapon options: Bow (short, long, heavy), gun (assault, shotgun), spear thrower (its like a bow, but not). First off, none of these are particularly interesting design wise (most bland human weapons possible, and I feel like the Na'vi could have innovated a bit beyond just a bow, like bolas or somesuch). Also notice how there are no melee weapons at all? You can only punch and kick, which as you can imagine just isn't effective or fun. So even when swarmed you gotta charge up every arrow to kill everyone. Which reminds me, all these bows and spear throwers have a wind up time which slows combat a lot, you can't do any quick moves. They TRIED to spice things up by giving every weapon a special ammo type (incendiary, electric, etc) but that had 2 problems. The first is those special ammo ALL REQUIRE A RARE RESSOURCE. THE SAME ONE. So I want fire arrows for my longbow well now I ran out of herbs to make the special ammo for my other weapons too. I could not be assed to farm for that specific ressource. Was not plentiful enough at all in the world. Secondly, nearly every enemy died in 1 hit. The optimal play every time is to stealth and 1 shot every enemy. All the mechs have weak points that neutralize them, animals have weak spots you MUST hit for a clean kill, humans all die in 1 hit from anything. So why bother with status effects and special ammo at all? Only a select few enemies had armored weakpoints that required a few more hits. Of course, if enemies are alerted and you can't hit the weakpoints its a different matter, but that wasn't the usual scenario until much later in the game where stealthing and weakpoint hits were a bit more challenging.<br/>
**-- Low enemy variety.** There were humans (might have 3-4 different weapons), and bipedal mechs. Thats most of what you fought for the whole gaming barring a few animal predators here and there. The DLC improved on mech variety a lot which I appreciate. The third DLC (which I did not play) also seeemed like it added a ton of new enemies.<br/>
**-- INVENTORY.** So now you must be thinking "but Louis, can't you just buy the acrid pods for the special ammo instead? Or buy the food for the boring quests?" YOU WOULD THINK SO. Alas, the vendors in this game only sell either blueprints to craft stuff, attachments for gear (which are uncraftable anyways), or a RANDOM assortment of mid to low tier materials (and only ever a single one of each). On top of this, your only currency is "clan favor" (gained from quests), which has a maximum cap and the good materials take a good chunk of favor. "But Louis, sell your junk you surely accumulated by looting everything!". No, you cannot sell anything to vendors. You have to find a "community chest" and dump your shit in there for a pittance of favor. Oh and pouches were limited to 50 in size. And you couldn't drop more than 10 things at your feet before the "loot pickup" was maxed and you had to move to drop it elsewhere. And the in-game "stash" also had a limit of 250 items. So for most of the game I was at max clan favor (with nothing to buy), so selling wasn't worthwhile, and my inventory was full, the stash was full, and dropping stuff was annoying. Kind of breaks the whole loot system and made interacting with it not worth it. The only thing that COULD have been worth buying, attachments (uncraftable), were made pointless by the fact that they just gave boring, useless stat bonuses such as: +9% RDA damage, +12% stealth damage, +10% speed while low on health, +5% mounted damage (remember everything is 1 shot anyways). I will note, the DLC made attachments much better and worthwhile to use. The whole inventory / vendor / currency / stash loop was just fundamentally broken. It desperatly needed a "sell junk" button and a currency that didn't have a limit.<br/>
**- Mounted combat.** Besides your Ikran, you could also ride the Direhorses! Thats fun right, traveling fast while seeing the landscape from the ground. Except of course, you can't call one on command like your Ikran, and they are only found in 1/3 of the map, and aren't found near fast travel points, and need to be "soothed" before riding (which can fail). So yea, I never actually rode a horse except for the story quest as you can imagine. I will note this was fixed in the first DLC, and there were horses at every relevant fast travel point, or something to call one already soothed, which is a good improvement.<br/>
**- My wishlist.** Having said all of this, heres my thoughts on what I think they should have done to raise the bar a little. Firstly, a good melee weapon. This game desperatly needed a faster weapon that was quick to use and felt like it did ok damage. Its fine if it's less than bow and can't hit weakpoints as well, but sometimes charging shots while the flamethrower mech is in your face just felt wrong. My second wish was more side quests that showcased the world. I wanted more quests that led to gorgeous vistas or unique locations. More quests that made you fight super strong predators in cool natural arenas (they were so close with legendary animal materials but they just didn't make cooler fights). Things that really showcase how cool Pandora can be. <br/>
